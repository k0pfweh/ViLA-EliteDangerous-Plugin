# ViLA-EliteDangerous-Plugin
This is working concept ViLA-Plugin (https://github.com/charliefoxtwo/ViLA) for Elite Dangerous based on the SamplePlugin.
Quick and dirty.

## Installation

To install the plugin, download the latest version from Releases and unzip it into the `Plugins/` folder of your ViLA installation (so you have `ViLA/Plugins/EliteDangerous/<dll files>`.) ViLA should auto-detect it on next run.
For a quick start, copy the `EliteDangerousConfiguration` folder over to ViLA's configuration folder.
